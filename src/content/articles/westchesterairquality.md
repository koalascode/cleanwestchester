Despite providing earth with essential protection when it is in the stratosphere, ozone (O3) is one of the most dangerous air pollutants when released into the lower atmosphere. It is one of the principal components of smog, and is emitted by everything from factories to cars to volatile chemical waste. Ozone is typically a problem on hot summer days, and is not a consistent risk. However, it is most dangerous during short periods of intense exposure, so the level of danger posed by ozone is measured as the number of days in which ground-level ozone concentrations reach hazardous levels.

Ozone is especially dangerous to people with children, the elderly, and people with respiratory conditions such as asthma, but it can be dangerous to all people, even at low concentrations, particularly if they are exposed for extended periods of time. 

Ozone can cause:
- Coughing and throat pain
- Difficulty and pain breathing
- Inflammation and damage to airways
- Increased susceptibility to lung infections
- Aggravation of pre-existing lung conditions
- Increased asthma attacks

These symptoms have been found in people both in and outside of at risk groups, but are far more common in at risk groups. Over half of Westchester’s population is considered at risk for worsened health effects due to ozone pollution.

Since 1996, the American Lung Association has been measuring and grading air quality across the nation, and Westchester has received an F every single year since 1996. The reason for this has been Westchester’s high levels of ozone air pollution. 

Some of the ozone pollutants facing Westchester locally are cars and industry, but much pollution likely came from other areas and migrated over to the Northeast. It is common for pollutants from as far as the midwest to settle in the Northeast, further diminishing our air quality.

Westchester isn’t the only area facing these problems. The Tri-State area is the 14th most polluted city in the U.S. in terms of ozone, and, as of 2016, 47% of New Yorkers live under unhealthy levels of air pollution.

On a national scale, 3 out of every 8 Americans, 122.3 million people, live in a county that failed the American Lung Association’s ozone tests.

In order to pass the test, a county must report less than 3.2 high ozone days per year. From 2018-2020, Westchester averaged nearly 5. Although this is still a failing grade, it does represent substantial progress.

From 2001-2003, Westchester averaged an astounding 29.3 high ozone days annually. Since then, there has been a somewhat steady improvement to get where we are today. However, there have been many recent threats making progress much more difficult. 

The spike from 2015-2018, in spite of efforts to lower emissions, is largely attributed to record setting heats, which leads to more high ozone days, signifying the challenge climate change poses to air quality progress.

However, working against the considerable challenges of both external pollution and climate change to protect our health are government reforms and regulations.
One of the most essential government protections of air quality is the Clean Air Act. Passed in 1970, the act allows the EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) to regulate emissions harmful to air quality and to create NAAQS (National Ambient Air Quality Standards).

These NAAQS allow for the federal government to work directly with states through the EPA and create plans to reduce pollution in order to meet the NAAQS. It also allows the EPA to enforce requirements on industrial emitters such as factories and power plants that reduce their negative effect on air quality.

The Clean Air Act, and its later revisions in 1990, have prevented 230,000 premature deaths each year and saved an estimated 22 trillion dollars in healthcare expenses. 

The Clean Air Act facilitates the passing of federal regulation, but also puts pressure on states and local governments to act and improve their air conditions as well.

One such local Westchester reform has been the Westchester County Health Department’s purchase of 5,600 units of HEPA air purifiers and filters to be put in thirty different Westchester school districts in 2022. This contract was made with 5.2 million dollars in federal funding, and should help improve air quality conditions for many Westchester students and teachers. The air filters purchased remove COVID-19, allergens, asthma triggers, and other pollutants under 0.1 microns, including ozone. 

Another important piece of legislation is the Westchester Diesel Emission Standards. Diesel engines are particularly harmful to air quality as one of the most significant emitters of fine particle pollutants, ozone-forming nitrogen oxides, and toxic air pollutants. This Westchester county regulation is taking crucial steps in reducing these harmful effects by requiring ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel alongside pollution control equipment such as filters should drastically reduce Diesel emissions in both consumer and industrial vehicles. This law, passed in 2006, set standards for all new Diesel engines and requires alterations to previous engines that do not meet those standards. 

These actions show that both the federal and county governments care about improving our air quality, and are working towards improving it. But what can you do to combat air pollution?

Here are some of the best ways you can Clean Westchester’s air:

Walk or bike instead of driving
Carpool or take public transportation
Make sure not to spill gasoline when filling tanks, make sure none is leaking from your car.
Make sure not to leave any chemical products with lids open or loose
Conserve electricity and/or pursue clean energy alternatives
Avoid turning up the air conditioning more than is necessary
Don’t burn leaves, wood, or trash
Advocate for continued and expanded government action against air pollution

Additionally, on days where high ozone levels are expected (which you can check here as well as many other weather websites) it is advised to try not to spend too much time outside. However, if you have to go outside, avoid strenuous activities that require excessive inhalation of pollutants and only go outside in the morning and evening, as ozone is typically most prevalent in the hot afternoon. 

To avoid making high ozone days escalate, make sure to abide by the guidelines to improve air quality above, and try not to use any gas powered equipment.

Ultimately, we are all only small parts of Westchester County, but if we all work together and do our part, we, alongside our governments, can make Westchester a better, cleaner, place to live.
