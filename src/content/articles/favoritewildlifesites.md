**Wildlife Sites in Westchester**

Though it lies just north of one of the biggest metropolitan centers in the world, Westchester still offers some of the most beautiful and interesting parks in the state and exhibits the diverse wildlife of the American Northeast. Whether you are looking for a spot to go on a hike or are genuinely interested in studying New York wildlife, the following parks offer an exciting and worthwhile experience.

# 1. Edith G. Read Wildlife Sanctuary

Situated behind Rye Playland, Edith G. Read Wildlife Sanctuary offers great sightseeing for wildlife enthusiasts and beachgoers alike. It is open all year, and although the weather is more favorable in the summer, the Park still fosters many interesting species during the winter season.

As it lies on the Atlantic migratory flyway, the sanctuary is specifically great for birders––251 different species have been sighted there, making it the third most active birding hotspot in Westchester. It is also home to other forms of wildlife such as deer and beavers. The park has a beach on Manursing Island as well, and it offers many great sights of the Long Island Sound. Playland Lake lies behind the Island.

The Wildlife Sanctuary is a great place to bring a whole family, and it is highly recommended for those who want to familiarize themselves with our local wildlife.

# 2. Croton Point Park

Croton Point is a peninsula near the village of Croton-on-Hudson. It has a beach on the Hudson River where the public is free to swim in the water, and several bird feeders throughout the park make it a great birding site as well––the second most active hotspot in Westchester.

![Screen Shot 2023-01-14 at 6.46.46 PM.png](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/73763bd0-1a23-43d6-a024-9db02b6c90fe/Screen_Shot_2023-01-14_at_6.46.46_PM.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20230204%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230204T164819Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=dcfd5b179f3be135f8bcb14c60bfc8fb6c1e258bbd483b1e103bc8ca9224abd7&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename%3D%22Screen%2520Shot%25202023-01-14%2520at%25206.46.46%2520PM.png%22&x-id=GetObject)

The Park has both a bay and a marsh, which make it great for walking and relaxing. There are also many cabins on Park grounds that are used for camping in the Summer. However, the park was not always this way, as the Point was an Underhill family farm during the 19th century and much of the Park became a dump in 1927. Eventually, the dump was closed and the land that was once covered in trash is now a grassy hill. Before Underhill ownership, the Point still had a rich history––archaeologists have uncovered evidence of Native Americans inhabiting the land nearly 7 millennia ago. Moreover, the frigate that Major John André had planned to board in order to meet with Benedict Arnold to discuss his defection was anchored off of Croton Point before it was moved to the west side of the River and then downstream, resulting in André’s capture and execution.

# 3. Marshlands Conservancy

Positioned only a few miles southeast of Edith G. Read Wildlife Sanctuary, the Marshlands Conservancy offers a similarly alluring view of the Long Island Sound. The park also fosters thriving forests, meadows, and salt marshes, and is yet another great spot for spotting migratory birds. It is the most active birding hotspot in all of Westchester, with sightings of 274 different species being logged there.

There is evidence for thousands of years of Native American settlement on the conservancy land, and it is one of only two significant archaeological sites within Rye. Since the early-19th century, the land belonged to two estates, one of which was that of John Jay, a Founding Father and the 1st Chief Justice of the United States.

Although the park also boasts an impressive ecosystem of native plants, its biodiversity has declined as invasive species such as the Norway Maple have harmed local wildlife.

# 4. Cranberry Lake Preserve

Just south of the Kensico Reservoir, the Cranberry Lake Preserve is a unique 190-acre park that has notable populations of birds, turtles, dragonflies, and aquatic wildlife. The two namesake lakes are surrounded by forests and swampland, and are home to a diverse array of plants and animals that are protected by the park’s ban on biking, fishing and dogs.

The Cranberry Lake Preserve Loop is a leisurely 3.6 mile walk that passes by both lakes and is suitable for all ages. It is a highly recommended trail for families who are looking for easy hikes that are still in the heart of natural environments.

# 5. Greenburgh Nature Center

Located on Dromore Road, Greenburgh Nature Center is a diamond in the rough between the bustling streets of Bronx River Parkway and Central Park Avenue. Not only is it home to 33 acres of wildlife reserve, but it also has an animal museum with dozens of species. The center offers birthday parties where children can choose several animals to take out, and there is also a volunteer program with more than 100 active members.

With the nearest zoo in the Bronx, Greenburgh Nature Center is a popular site for local children to observe and learn about local wildlife and exotic species from all around the world. Animals at the center include two bald eagles, five different species of tortoise, a red-tailed boa, and three chinchillas; with many more animals which are cared for daily by the center’s staff and volunteers. The center is also home to a summer camp for children from kindergarten to fourth grade.
