This weekend we returned to an old favorite, Weinberg Nature Center. We love coming to the Weniberg Nature Center since there is always trash from the nearby highway enterence, which is especially damaging given that the nature center is vital for many local species.

Overall, we had a great turnout this weekend, and we were able to pick up a solid amount of trash.
