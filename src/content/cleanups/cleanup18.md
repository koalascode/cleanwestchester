Another clean up with lower turnouts than usual, this week becuase of end of quarter exams and papers. Luckily, we were still able to have a great clean up, where we picked up a large amount of trash from the river bank of the Bronx River. We found a large bottle deposit, one which we had [cleaned up before](https://www.cleanwestchester.org/cleanups/cleanup15), but it seems that it is an area of buildup.
