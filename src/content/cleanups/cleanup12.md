This weekend's clean up had a lower attendance than most due to research papers and finals. Since the vast majority of our members are students, during weekends when there are finals and other large assignments we have lower turnouts. However, this lower turnout did not stop us from having a great clean-up, and picking up a large amount of trash.

We love coming to Weinberg Nature Center since we always find a lot of trash in an area that is vital to local wildlife, a topic that we further discussed in a [previous clean up recap](https://www.cleanwestchester.org/cleanups/cleanup9).
