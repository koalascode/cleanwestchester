This weekend's bi-weekly clean-up came at an unfortunate time, with the SAT, many tests, and a location which is further from most of our members, turnout was less than usual. But this did not stop us from getting to work and getting a large amount done. We found a large number of glass bottles, plastic, and more.

Plastics in Edith G. Read are very harmful for the local wildlife, as it is a sanctuary for many species. Pieces of plastic that we find on the banks of the pond are important to collect as they interfere with the turtles, ducks, and other wildlife.

Throughout our clean-up, we found a large amount of shattered glass bottles. These bottles are hazardous to the local wildlife for a number of reasons, which is why we spent a large amount of time carefullyl picking up these glass shards.

Although the turnout from this clean-up was lower, we met some new faces from Rye, and had a great time.

Thank you to all participants, see you all in two weeks.
