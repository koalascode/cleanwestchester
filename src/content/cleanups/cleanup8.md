This weekend we partnered with the Pleasantville High School Sustainability Club to have a clean-up near the Pleasantville Pool. There is a section of streams that pour into the lake along the power lines which is littered with trash, making the plastic waste there more hazardous than in other places.

Throughout a section of ponds that ran throughout our walk we found constant cans and plastic waste. This is disruptive to the local wildlife, such as frogs that were laying eggs in a nearby section.

We also found a large bank of plastic bottles that were deposited. These bottles filled about 2 large garbage bags.

We had to come up with some ways to try and reach some bottles in the stream. Our solution was risky, but it worked, and we used it to collect some hard to get pieces of garbage.
