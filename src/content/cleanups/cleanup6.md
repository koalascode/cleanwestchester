After a week off for break, we came back to clean the Weinberg Natuer Center and the entrance to the Hutch. There is a trail along the Weinberg Nature Center that borders the entrance of the Hutch.

For years there has been an accumulation of trash along along this strip. We found bottles that are many years old, such as antique Gatorade bottle, back from the time that they were made with glass.

Great clean-up overall, we collected a large amount of trash, making the entrance to our community and a local wildlife area cleaner. Thank you to all 11 participants, see you all next week!
