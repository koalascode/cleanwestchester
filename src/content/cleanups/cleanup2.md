Our second clean-up was a success. We cleaned the Bronx River (specifically the part near Scarsdale) and were able to collect multiple bags, most of which consisted of plastic that we found in the river. We saw and picked up countless plastic bags, straws, and bottles while walking downstream.

To provide a brief background of the area we cleaned up, The Bronx River crosses through many towns and is alongside the large Bronx River parkway, which contributes to a large amount of garbage that is found near the river. This garbage accumulates on the sides of the riverbed, and some of it makes its way directly into the flow of water.

The fact that large amounts of trash are finding their way into the Bronx River is highly problematic and concerning for many reasons. The most visible is that there are many animals that reside near and inside the river such as the ducks that we encountered during the clean-up. These ducks are vulnerable to things like plastic, which they can get entangled in or digest on accident, causing many issues due to plasticâ€™s harmful chemicals.

The Bronx River continues its course for miles before emptying into the East River, bringing trash into the larger river, affecting more wildlife and biodiversity.

Hopefully, this and many other clean-ups and the pieces of content and articles that we produce with it will be positive in terms of spreading awareness for the amount of plastic waste that is improperly disposed of and other environmental problems that are affecting our local communities. To see more, check out our video above, our YouTube Channel (Clean Westchester), and our Instagram (@cleanwestchester) to see when and where our next clean-ups will be.

More Clean Ups will be happening soon, with many during the 2022-2023 school year, so stay tuned for those.
