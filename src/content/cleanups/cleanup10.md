This weekend we had an unfortunatly low turnout due to AT US History Research Papers and AP exams. However, we still had our clean-up. We had to pospone from the previous week due to a rainstorm, and it did not feel right to keep posponing.

We went back to one of our favorite trails, a section of the Bronx River that passes through Scarsdale. There is a large amount of trash that we find on these trails which borders on the river, harming the nearby wildlife.

We are extatic for the warm weather to be back. [Last summer we came to the Bronx River](https://www.cleanwestchester.org/cleanups/cleanup2) and saw firsthand the amount of wildlife that congregates in the river, making every piece of trash that we collect even more important.

Thank you to everyone who participated, we hope to see you all in two weeks!
