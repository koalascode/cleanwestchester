Unfortunately, this week our turnout was much smaller than usual. Many people were bogged down by tests, college deadlines, and more. However, we still got out to the Bronx River and continued with out Bi-Weekly clean ups (even though we had to pospone last week).

The Bronx River is a crucial place for clean-ups, as discussed [here](https://www.cleanwestchester.org/cleanups/cleanup5) because of its proximity to local wildlife.
