Last weekend we headed towards the Bronx River, one of our favorite spots, to have another clean-up. We love going to the Bronx River since there's always trash on the river bank, which has a large impact on the wildlife throughout Westchester, hence every piece of trash picked up is extra important.

We went along the river bank, collecting pieces of trash as we went.

In the end, we were able to collect 7 bags of trash from the river bank, a good haul.

A huge thank you to all the participants who came for over an hour to help with the clean-up.
