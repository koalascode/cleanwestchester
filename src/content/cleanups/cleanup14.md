We are back to our regularly scheduled bi-weekly clean-ups for the 2023-24 school year! For our first clean-up of the school year, we returned to an old favorite, the Weinberg Nature Center. This location is vital to the local habitat as it is home to many species.

We were able to collect a large amount of trash throughout the trails in the nature center. Trash tends to accumulate in the area near the highway entrance and exit.
