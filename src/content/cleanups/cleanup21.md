Unfortunately, we had to pospone this weeks clean up because of the rain last week. Fortunately, this clean up had a massive attendance, with 15 Clean Westchester members. We are thrilled to have been consistently increasing our turnouts, and as a result have been able to collect more trash in crucial places, like the Bronx River.
