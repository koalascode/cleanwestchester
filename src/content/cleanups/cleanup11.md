This weekend we had a nice clean-up at Weinberg Nature Center. The importance of Weinberg Nature Center and it's surroundings is highlighted in a [previous clean-up article](https://www.cleanwestchester.org/cleanups/cleanup9).

Here are some photos of the clean-up:

There are less photos than usual becuase Aaron, out usual photographer, was at a hackathon.

All photos from Clean Westchester events can be found on [our instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cleanwestchester/).

Thank you to all our participants, hope to see you all in two weeks!
