This clean up came a bit late. We took Winter Break and Christmas off, and had our return delayed twice (once by rain and then another time by a large snowstorm). But, we are finally back, and ready to tackle this new year! This weekend we returned to Sheldrake, one of our favorite places, since it is crucual for local wildlife and is usually quite litter prone.
