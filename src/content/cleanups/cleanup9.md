This weekend for our bi-weekly clean-up we went back to a place that we [had cleaned a few months ago](https://www.cleanwestchester.org/cleanups/cleanup6), the trail by the edge of Weinberg Nature Center that borders the hutch.

The first time we came to this trail we found a large amount of trash, and we did our best to clean the opening part of the highway, but even in an hour and a half, we were not able to finish cleaning the small trail. So we decided to come back today.

This trail is very important to maintain clean because it is one that is connected to the Weinberg Nature Center, a place where local wildlife congregates and where people often go for a few hours in the outdoors. 
We found a large amount of trash, filling up 5 large trash bags from what we found across the trail. Trash accumulates in this area since people who are exiting the hutch throw away garbage here, littering a variety of items including bottles, clothes, takeout, and more.
