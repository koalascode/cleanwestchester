We decided to move up next week's clean-up to this week, since when we were scouting places for clean-ups we found a massive bottle deposit that we needed to pick up. Sheldrake lake is a place where local wildlife lives, and picking up the trash here is especially important for that reason.

All photos from this clean up and all other events can be found on [our instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cleanwestchester/).

This is the first time that we came to Sheldrake Lake, and since we started on a trail nearby we were not able to go all the way around the lake. We plan to find a new trail next time and to go around more of the lake soon.

Thank you to everyone who came to the clean up this week. Hope to see you all in two weeks!
