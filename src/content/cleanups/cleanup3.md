During 2023 we will be holding a clean-up every other Sunday at 2:30 PM. This was the first of this series.

We headed down the Bronx River for our first installment because we have already held a clean-up here and knew there was always litter from the highway nearby.

The first item that we came across by the highway was the remnants of a crash. The plastic from the carâ€™s bumper, door, and back fenders was laying across the grass patches by the river, so we took them and deposited them.

Besides from the car, we found a few bags worth of plastic on the side of the river bank. This included plastic bottles, straws (our mortal enemy), and more.

It was a great clean-up, and we are looking forward to many more in the next year.
