For our first summer clean-up we went to the Bronx River. We went right before the rain started, a perfect time as throughout the clean up we saw some trash that was already being brought through the river by the rain from earlier in the day. We got a large amount of trash from the bank of the river before it was able to get washed through the stream.

We made it a long way throughout the trail, but chose not to continue since the bridge was flooded.
