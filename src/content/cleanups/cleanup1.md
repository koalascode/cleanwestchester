We did not pick an ideal day for our clean-up, as it was below freezing and pouring for the entirety of the clean-up, but the logic for picking this day was sound. We have found that on Saturdays there is a lot of litter on the ground since people on Fridays go out and throw beer cans, red bulls, and coffees out of their car windows. Hence, on Saturday there is a great deal of litter on the side of the roads.

We had decent success with our collection, we collected about 2 full bags of trash, which amounted to about 10lbs of plastic waste.
