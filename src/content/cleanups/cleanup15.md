This weekend we had a great clean-up at the Bronx River. We found and collected record amounts of trash since we found a massive deposit of plastic bottles near the river bank. This is especially damaging since nearby a family of ducks swam and other wildlife is always prescent in the area.

The overall haul from this week was sizeable, we had about 5 large trash bags filled from waste on the river bank.
